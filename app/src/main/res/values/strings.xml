    <string name="drill_dewalt_info">DeWALT Drill and grinders come equipped with the Anti-Rotation E-CLUTCH® System. Compared to standard clutches, E-CLUTCH® helps minimize sudden torque reaction in drills by detecting the motion of the tool and shutting it down in bind-up situations. In grinders, E-CLUTCH® shuts the motor down in under a tenth of a second when a pinch/stall is detected.</string>
